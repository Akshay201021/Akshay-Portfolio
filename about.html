           <h3>About Akshay</h3> 
            Hello! My name is Akshay, and I am a passionate coder with a deep love for HTML and web development. 
            Ever since I wrote my first line of HTML code, I have been fascinated by the ability to create and design web pages that can be accessed 
            by anyone, anywhere in the world.
            
            <h3>My Journey into HTML Coding</h3>
            My journey into the world of HTML coding began during my high school years when I took a basic web development course. 
            The process of building a web page from scratch using simple HTML tags was incredibly rewarding. 
            I started by creating small personal websites and quickly realized that I wanted to dive deeper into the intricacies of web 
            development.
            
           <h3>Why I Love HTML</h3> 
            HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the backbone of the web. It provides the structure and layout for web pages,
             making it an essential skill for any web developer. What I love most about HTML is its simplicity and power. 
             With just a few lines of code, you can create content that is accessible, engaging, and interactive. 
             HTML is also constantly evolving, with new features and standards that keep the field exciting and dynamic.
            
            <h3>My Projects</h3>
            Over the years, I have worked on a variety of projects, ranging from personal blogs to complex web applications. 
            Some of my favorite projects include:
            
            Personal Portfolio Website: A showcase of my skills, projects, and achievements, built entirely with HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript.
            Responsive Web Design: Creating websites that look great on any device, using modern HTML5 and CSS3 techniques.
            Interactive Forms: Building user-friendly forms that enhance the user experience with features like validation, accessibility, and dynamic content.
